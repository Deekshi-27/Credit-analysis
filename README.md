# Credit-analysis

This project presents an innovative approach to credit analysis by combining the power of CatBoost—a gradient boosting library optimized for categorical data—with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to capture temporal patterns in credit histories. Designed to automate and enhance creditworthiness assessment for individuals and businesses, this model reduces human error and improves accuracy by analyzing features like employment type, income source, and loan purpose. Ideal for financial institutions seeking efficient, data-driven credit evaluation.
